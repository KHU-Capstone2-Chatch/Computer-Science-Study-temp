# Lecture 01 - Overview
## Understanding Basic Networking Technologies
### IP Address
- to each device connected to a computer network 
that uses the Internet Protocol for communication
- two main functions
    - host or network interface identification
    - location addressing

### Port Number
- Identification a specific process or a type of network service
- 일반적으로 사용 용도가 정해져 있는 포트 넘버도 있다
ex) 80 : HTTP used in WWW, 67/68 : DHCP

### Domain Name
- Identification computers, services, and other resources reachable 
through the Internet or other Internet Protocol networks.

#### Domain Name System (DNS)
- translation domain names to the numerical IP addresses 
for locating and identifying computer services and devices

#### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
- dynamically assigns an IP address
and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network 
so they can communicate with other IP network

- DHCP server : IP 주소가 필요할 때 할당 해준다.

#### HTTP
- web client & server
- HTTP request & response
